Florent Dufour here. I am a data scientist and biologist. I build machines that learn and help save lives. I believe in an open world and I am committed to academic research. I am bold, creative, and I cultivate my practical sense. I welcome competition, teamwork, and high-stakes challenges. I am eager to address the challenges of today’s world and decided to drive human health forward.

Other than that, I travel the world on my motorcycle 🏍️, photograph 📸, write 📝, and hack 🤖.
